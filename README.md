# QUANTUM COMPUTING AND CYBERSECURITY
EC601 A2 Team 3

## Product Mission
Make cybersecurity professionals aware of the risk that quantum computers suppose for classical encryption algorithms, providing them with 2 safe alternatives: one based on Quantum Key Distribution, and the other on Post-quantum cryptography.

## Users
- Cybersecurity researchers (private companies, universities, government)
- Cybersecurity engineers (private companies and public institutions)
- Cybersecurity enthusiasts

## User Stories and MVP
1. I, cybersecurity researcher, want a good explanation of the concepts to be able to expand them in the future.
2. I, cybersecurity researcher, want a source code for encryption algorithms to take it as a reference for further developments.
3. I, cybersecurity researcher, want to have the chance to test the encryption algorithms.
4. I, cybersecurity researcher, want an environment to test the encryption algorithms.
5. I cybersecurity engineer, want an interface that allows me to manage the encryption of data and check if it is working.
6. I, cybersecurity engineer, want a way to contact a support team in case there were issues.
7. I, cybersecurity enthusiast, want an open source code of the encryption methods to have the chance to study them and potentially contribute to their improvement.
