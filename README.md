# QUANTUM COMPUTING AND CYBERSECURITY
EC601 A2 Team 3

## Product Mission
Make cybersecurity professionals aware of the risk that quantum computers suppose for classical encryption algorithms, providing them with 2 safe alternatives: one based on Quantum Key Distribution, and the other on Post-quantum cryptography.

## Users
- Cybersecurity professional, including researchers (private companies, universities, government) engineers (private companies and public institutions)
- Cybersecurity enthusiasts

## User Stories and MVP
1. I, cybersecurity professional, want a solution that takes advantage of the capabilities of quantum mechanics. <code style="color : greenyellow">Now</code>
2. I, cybersecurity professional, want an encryption system that protects classical computers againt quantum computers. <code style="color : greenyellow">Now</code>
3. I, cybersecurity professional, want to have the chance to test the encryption algorithms. <code style="color : greenyellow">Now</code>
4. I, cybersecurity researcher, want a good explanation of the concepts to be able to expand them in the future. <code style="color : greenyellow">Now</code>
5. I, cybersecurity researcher, want a source code for encryption algorithms to take it as a reference for further developments. <code style="color : greenyellow">Now</code>
6. I cybersecurity engineer, want an interface that allows me to manage the encryption of data and check if it is working. <code style="color : greenyellow">Later</code>
7. I, cybersecurity engineer, want a way to contact a support team in case there were issues. <code style="color : greenyellow">Now</code>
8. I, cybersecurity enthusiast, want an open source code of the encryption methods to have the chance to study them and potentially contribute to their improvement. <code style="color : greenyellow">Later</code>
