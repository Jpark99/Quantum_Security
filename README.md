# QUANTUM COMPUTING AND CYBERSECURITY
EC601 A2 Team 3

## Product Mission
Make cybersecurity professionals aware of the risk that quantum computers suppose for classical encryption algorithms, providing them with 2 safe alternatives: one based on Quantum Key Distribution, and the other on Post-quantum cryptography.

## Users
- Cybersecurity professional, including researchers (private companies, universities, government) engineers (private companies and public institutions)
- Cybersecurity enthusiasts

## User Stories and MVP
