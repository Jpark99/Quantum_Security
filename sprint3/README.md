## Sprint 3: Quantum Computation and Cybersecurity

So far, we have implemented the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution protocol for key generation and we have integrated it with the symmetric AES algorithm for the encryption of data. The procedure is the following:
1. Use BB84 QKD protocol for safe generation of a encryption key. If somebody tries to
